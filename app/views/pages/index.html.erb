<h1>Welcome to Hire Neighbors</h1>

<p>Our goal is to bring neighborhoods and communities together by matching neighbors who have skills and talents with neighbors who need those skills.</p>

<p>With a focus on local retirees and stay at home moms/dads who want to advertise their skills and capabilities for hire and gain some extra income, keep their skills fresh, stay active and engage with others in their neighborhood.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Are you one of the millions of baby boomers reaching retirement age?</li> 
    <li>Are you a talented and skilled stay at home mom or dad?</li> 
    <li>Do you want or need supplemental income?</li> 
    <li>Do you want to continue to use your talents and skills developed over years of working?</li> 
    <li>Do you have a hobby or a passion you want to be your second career?</li> 
    <li>Do you NOT want to go back into a corporate job or even a part time job?</li> 
</ul>

<p>If so, this site is for you!!  Many retirees have great skills and talents grown during the years of working and your neighbors may need those talents.</p>
