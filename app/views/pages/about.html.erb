<h1>About</h1>
<h4 class="quote">"This site will bring neighbors and the community closer together."</h4>

<p>Built by retirees and talented individuals who found themselves in a situation where they needed to
find a way to advertise their skills for hire within their own neighborhood.</p>

<p>As a member of a community blog site we saw the need daily from postings by our neighbors asking for references or
help to find someone to paint baseboards, cabinet making, to interior decorating, to a request for a
tutor, someone to pick up their elderly mother or to help with pet and house sitting. We realized we
live in a neighborhood full of talented and skilled individuals who have some time on
their hands. So why not give them a platform to advertise in their own neighborhood, get to know
their neighbors, earn some extra income and create a community bond.</p>

<p>This site is not for companies but for talented and skilled neighbors! It's about the community helping each other.</p>

<p>With 30+ years professional business experience we know what it is like to juggle your home, family, work and 
responsibilities, it is a comfort to know you can hire someone in your neighborhood to help you out.</p>

<p>We hope you find this site of value and of use. We have a vision that this site will bring neighbors and the 
community closer together and one thing for sure â€“ you know where they live.</p>
